I chose to do this project kind of as a way to apply my current programming knowledge to something tangible and visible.
I know this isn't the most impressive thing in the world, but it took a lot of trial and error to get to where I am now, and I know that there is only more work along the way.

As I gain experience, I'd like to make this program a little more robust and structured, because as of now it only runs in the console (and the created result.txt folder).

Looking at this now, there's still more to be done, but it's outside the scope of what I started this project for in the first place. It's time to move onto the next big project, whatever that is. I'll revisit this repository eventually to add more, but as of now bigger and better things call my name.
