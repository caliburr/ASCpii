I chose to do this project kind of as a way to apply my current programming knowledge to something tangible and visible.
I know this isn't the most impressive thing in the world, but it took a lot of trial and error to get to where I am now, and I know that there is only more work along the way.

As I gain experience, I'd like to make this program a little more robust and structured, because as of now it only runs in the console (and the created result.txt folder).
